# Ergonnection

Ergonnection is a Java 17+ library for communicating with nodes of the [Ergo](https://ergoplatform.com/) network.

## Roadmap

- [x] Handshake
- [x] Implement all messages (both serialization and deserialization)
- [x] Implement all records (Peer, Feature, etc.)
- [x] Encoding utilities
- [x] Handling modifiers, to listen for things like transactions
- [ ] Publish on Maven central
- [ ] Tests

## Example

It can be used both in blocking mode which does not start a new thread and requires you to accept messages manually and in non-blocking mode which takes listeners and calls them from another thread.

```java
ErgoSocket ergoSocket = new ErgoSocket(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 9030), new Peer("mysocket", "mysocket-1.0.0", Version.parse("5.0.12"), ErgoSocket.BASIC_FEATURE_SET));
ergoSocket.sendHandshake();
ergoSocket.acceptHandshake();
```

Non-blocking mode

```java
ergoSocket.listen().specific(Peers.class, message -> {
	// This code is executed in another thread
	for (Peer peer : message.peers()) {
		System.out.println(peer);
	}
});
ergoSocket.send(new GetPeers());
```

Blocking mode

```java
ergoSocket.send(new GetPeers());
while (true) {
	ProtocolMessage message = ergoSocket.acceptMessage();
	if (message instanceof Peers message) {
		for (Peer peer : message.peers()) {
			System.out.println(peer);
		}
	}
}
```

### Example: Transactions
Listen for transactions sent to the network: [TransactionLoggerExample.java](/examples/TransactionLoggerExample.java).

### Testnet
If you want to connect to a testnet node instead, you need to provide the magic bytes for that like this:
```java
ErgoSocket ergoSocket = new ErgoSocket(address, self, ErgoSocket.TESTNET_MAGIC);
```

## Notes

Please understand that ergonnection is only a networking library.
This means that the transactions you receive using this tool could be faked.
For this reason, unless you do this verification yourself,
only connect to nodes that you own if you want to guarantee correct data.
The blockchain is not saved and nothing is checked.

Note that if you only intend to receive messages and not do anything, you will be disconnected
after 10 minutes by the other peer. For this reason, make sure to not remain inactive for 10 minutes.

Also note that the other peer could disconnect you (peer eviction), so make sure to set up
auto-reconnection logic if you intend to stay connected for a long amount of time.
